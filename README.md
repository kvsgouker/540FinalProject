# Project 6: Global Theme Park Attendance & Ride Analysis

This project builds a complete, cleaned, and enriched dataset of amusement parks and roller coasters by integrating multiple real-world data sources:
• Attendance data (2006–2022) from Wikipedia and Queue Times
• Ride characteristics from the Roller Coaster Database (RCDB)
• Park metadata via geolocation and Queue Times API
• Data transformations including fuzzy matching, deduplication, and normalization
• Outputs a consistent and queryable SQL dataset

This work showcases advanced data wrangling, web scraping, API usage, and exploratory data analysis using Python, BeautifulSoup, pandas, and SQLite. It provides a foundation for studying the relationship between rides, parks, and visitor attendance trends over time.
