# Global Theme Park Attendance & Ride Analysis

This project integrates and analyzes multiple datasets related to global theme park attendance and ride features. By combining data from Queue-Times, the Roller Coaster Database (RCDB), and Wikipedia, it builds a unified, structured dataset to explore patterns in park popularity, ride characteristics, and visitor behavior.

## Summary

The goal was to merge and clean complex, messy data from different sources to answer questions like:
- Which parks consistently draw the most visitors worldwide?
- How do ride attributes (e.g. height, speed, capacity) correlate with popularity?
- Can inconsistent formats across sources be reconciled into a usable SQL-backed dataset?

## Data Sources

- **Wikipedia** — Global theme park attendance figures (2006–2022)
- **Queue-Times API** — Real-time and historical ride and park metadata
- **Roller Coaster Database (RCDB)** — Ride features (height, length, speed, duration, etc.)

## Methods

- Web scraping and API querying to gather raw data
- Data cleaning:
  - Dropped and renamed inconsistent columns
  - Fixed malformed headers and missing data
  - Removed irrelevant or duplicate records
- Merged datasets by applying fuzzy matching and name normalization
- Built a local SQL database for structured queries and analysis

## Key Insights

- Created a comprehensive and queryable dataset of parks and rides
- Identified outliers and high-capacity attractions
- Detected format inconsistencies and documented corrections for future automation

## Tools & Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- JupyterLab
- pandas
- numpy
- sqlite3
- fuzzywuzzy
- requests
- BeautifulSoup
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualizations)

## Limitations & Notes

- Queue-Times API occasionally timed out or delivered incomplete results
- RCDB and Wikipedia data required manual adjustments for structural mismatches
- Some ride and park names had to be standardized manually
